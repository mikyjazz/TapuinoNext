    If you wish to produce and sell kits at cost as a service to the community, I'd love to know about this.
    Contact me at sweetlilmre@gmail.com and we can sort something out.

    If you are a commercial business that wishes to build and sell the TapuinoNext you need to obtain a licence from me to do so.
    You can contact me at sweetlilmre@gmail.com to discuss this.

Why the restriction on commercial licensing?
    Without getting into detail, let's just say I've been burnt before. I spent an amazing amount of time developing first
    the Tapuino and then the TapuinoNext. I did this so that people could share and benefit from the work and so that I
    could give something back to the wonderful C64 community. However, I would like to retain some control over how the
    Tapuino Next is used commercially.
